*Directions:*

Two players must compete to move all their pieces from the start zone to the finish zone. The squares on the left and right sides of the board belong to each player, but the middle strip is in contest.

Each turn, the player rolls 4d2 and can move any one piece of theirs by that amount exactly (no subdividing). There are also five special squares, called rosettes, upon which if you land you are awarded another die roll on that turn. If you land on an opponent's piece, it is booted back to it's start zone, except in the case of the middle rosette: this square is safe and a piece on it cannot be booted. You cannot boot your own piece.

The first player to move all their pieces to their end zone wins. Happy playing!
